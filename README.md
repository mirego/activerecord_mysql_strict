# ActiveRecord::MySQL::Strict

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/activerecord_mysql_strict.png)](https://rubygems.org/gems/activerecord_mysql_strict)

`ActiveRecord::MySQL::Strict` adds validations to ActiveRecord models to make sure they do not trigger errors in MySQL strict mode.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'activerecord_mysql_strict'
```

## Usage

```ruby
create_table "events" do |t|
  t.string   "name"
  t.string   "email", limit: 128
  t.text     "description"
  t.integer  "people_count"
end

class Event < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_strict_columns
end

# String columns

event = Event.new(name: '.' * 400)
event.valid? # => false

event = Event.new(name: '.' * 255)
event.valid? # => true

event = Event.new(email: '.' * 200)
event.valid? # => false

event = Event.new(email: '.' * 100)
event.valid? # => true

# Text columns

event = Event.new(description: '.' * 70000)
event.valid? # => false

event = Event.new(description: '.' * 65535)
event.valid? # => true

# Integer columns

event = Event.new(people_count: 9999999999)
event.valid? # => false

event = Event.new(people_count: 2147483647)
event.valid? # => true
```

### Options
